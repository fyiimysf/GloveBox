# GloveBox

**GloveBox** is a modern, sleek URL stashing and bookmarking web app that combines aesthetics with functionality. With a **glassmorphism-inspired UI**, it allows users to easily store, manage, and access their favorite URLs. The app fetches **Open Graph meta tags** to display rich, useful previews for each link.

GloveBox is built with **SvelteKit** for a reactive, fast interface, and **Tailwind CSS** for clean, modern styling. It also includes a **custom OpenGraph API** for automatic metadata fetching. Best of all, GloveBox is fully hosted and provides an **easy-to-use, private, and secure bookmarking experience** with **local data storage** and **backup options**.
